## Market landscape (live)

**Source of truth:** [Greater Sacramento Autumn Season - Market Landscape](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Va0oCv09nyW98-JnWL9DuYYTsXG35cxjf_WqBZsySrA/edit) — edit **All** only; browse **2026** section bands and **2025** on year tabs.

Seeded from coalition field notes and the internal *Greater Sacramento Autumn Season — Market Research* narrative.

Column schema: [Autumn market landscape schema](https://github.com/cPALSs/festival-network/blob/main/assets/autumn/research/market-landscape-schema.md) (in the [festival-network](https://github.com/cPALSs/festival-network) repo — clone for agents).

## Season coordination (essay)

**[Same calendar, different story](season-coordination.html)** — how Greater Sacramento's autumn events look like competition without intentional lane assignment, and what changes when each host owns a role and market. Sustainability and coordination over headcount.

## Schedule confidence — three tiers

The **2026** season is split by how sure we are about each occurrence:

| Tier | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Confirmed** | Calendar **steward** verified the date for planning |
| **Tentative** | Spoken to organizer; they gave a committed date but event is not finalized |
| **Estimated** | No organizer contact yet; date projected from prior year assuming recurrence |

### Confirmation rules (Confirmed)

1. **Primary gate — human confirmation:** A row becomes **Confirmed** when the calendar steward explicitly verifies it.
2. **Auto-signal — public listings:** Event posted on **Facebook**, **Eventbrite**, **Sacramento365**, organizer website, or equivalent with firm dates → treat as **Confirmed** (steward may bulk-accept or spot-check).
3. **Pre-public confirm:** Steward may set **Confirmed** before a public post when an organizer gave a **final committed date** in conversation.

**Audit columns on All tab:** `Confidence source` · `Confirmed by` · `Confirmed date`

## Sheet tabs

| Tab | Role |
|-----|------|
| **All** | Source of truth — edit here only |
| **2026** | All 2026 rows on one tab — **Confirmed** · **Tentative** · **Estimated** section bands (like Krewe Subunit Contacts) |
| **2025** | Last held season |

Re-run view tabs after editing **All** or changing schedule confidence:

```bash
cd Festival\ Network
node scripts/add-landscape-view-tabs.mjs
node scripts/seed-autumn-landscape-confidence.mjs   # if updating confidence on All
```

*(Scripts live in the coalition cPALSs monorepo — not published on this site.)*
