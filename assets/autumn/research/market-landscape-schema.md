# Market Landscape Schema

**Live sheet:** [Greater Sacramento Autumn Season - Market Landscape](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Va0oCv09nyW98-JnWL9DuYYTsXG35cxjf_WqBZsySrA/edit?usp=drive_link)

Row 1 in the Sheet must match these headers exactly.

## Sheet tabs

Tab order (left to right): **2026** · **2025** · **All**

| Tab | Role |
|-----|------|
| **2026** | Live view — all rows where `Season year` = 2026 |
| **2025** | Live view — all rows where `Season year` = 2025 |
| **All** | **Source of truth** — edit here only |

Year tabs are `FILTER` + `SORT` formulas (by **Dates**, then **Category**); they refresh when **All** changes. Do not edit year tabs directly. When a new season starts, add a year tab (re-run `scripts/add-landscape-view-tabs.mjs` or duplicate an existing year tab and update the formula).

## Column dictionary

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Category | Lane — e.g. `Mid-Autumn / Moon / Lantern`, `Autumn Family Fair`, `Activity Comp (reference)` |
| Tier | Priority within category — `1` (direct), `2`, `3`, or `A`/`B`/`C` for family fairs |
| Event Name | Display name |
| **event_id** | Stable slug linking all years of the same event — e.g. `cpalss-maf`, `caaps-lantern` |
| **Season year** | Calendar year this row describes — `2025`, `2026`, `2027`, or `reference` |
| **Row status** | `planning` · `confirmed` · `held` · `historical` · `cancelled` · `reference` |
| Host / Organizer | Producing org — **lead org first** (VACOS for MAF, cPALSs for EGLNY) |
| City | Primary city |
| Venue | Location detail |
| **Dates** | **This occurrence only** — lead with `YYYY-MM-DD` (year tabs sort on this column); add day/time after |
| Duration | Hours or days |
| Admission | Free, ticketed, parking notes |
| Attendance (number or range) | Best honest number or range |
| Attendance source | `Field estimate`, `Organizer claim`, `CCSD`, `Internal planning`, etc. |
| Vendor count (approx) | Booth/vendor scale if known |
| Lunar aligned | Yes / Partial / No |
| Vietnamese focus | Yes / Partial / No |
| Kids / family center | Yes / Partial / No |
| Lantern moment | Yes / Partial / No — procession, release, making |
| MAF overlap | Relationship to cPALSs/NVCC/VACOS MAF — `Our event`, `Direct comp`, `Substitute`, `Reference only` |
| Notes for reviewers | Steering context, honesty gaps, ecosystem notes |
| Source URL | Primary citation |
| Data gap | What is still unknown or unverified |

## Enums

**MAF overlap (common values):** Short labels for the Sheet — see [tone of voice](../../../docs/tone-of-voice.md) for plain English.

| Sheet value | Plain language |
|-------------|----------------|
| `Our event` | Coalition Mid-Autumn we produce |
| `Direct comp - same city` | Direct competitor in the same city |
| `Direct comp - spectacle product` | Direct competitor with a different spectacle (e.g. sky lanterns) |
| `Direct comp - late September` | Direct competitor in the same late-September window |
| `Direct comp - lunar weekend` | Direct competitor on lunar Mid-Autumn weekend |
| `Substitute - October` | Families might choose this instead in October |
| `Substitute - same city + ecosystem` | Same city; shared vendors or audience |
| `Reference only` | Not in the autumn competitive set |
| `Low - commercial` | Commercial/ticketed; weak fair comparison |
| `Low - church program` | Church program; not a full street fair |

**Attendance source:** Always set when attendance is non-empty. Distinguish press/organizer claims from on-the-ground estimates.

## Occurrence rows (one row per year)

- **Do not overwrite** last year's row when next year's date is announced — add a row (or copy → edit → set prior row to `held`).
- **Latest season only when dated:** For the current planning year (MAF 2026, LNY 2027, …), **do not add a row** until you have at least a tentative date from the organizer or a public listing. No `TBD` placeholder rows on the year tab.
- **Filter views** (recommended in Google Sheets):
  - **Current planning** — `Season year` = 2026 or 2027 · `Row status` = `planning` or `confirmed`
  - **Last held** — `Row status` = `held` · sort `Season year` descending
  - **By event** — filter `event_id` to see full history (e.g. `cpalss-maf`)

**Row status:**

| Value | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `planning` | Dates TBD or internal working row |
| `confirmed` | Public listing with firm dates |
| `held` | Event completed; attendance may be updated |
| `historical` | Prior-year archive; not in current comp set |
| `cancelled` | Announced then cancelled |
| `reference` | Out-of-season or out-of-region; not a calendar row |

**Colleague shortcuts (June 2026):**

| Ask | Tab |
|-----|-----|
| **MAF 2026 calendar** | **2026** (3 events as of Jun 2026 — CAAPS Sep 19, APIDA Center Sep 21, MAF Sep 25–26) |
| **Autumn 2025 (last held)** | **2025** |

## Data gap semantics

- Use **Data gap** for open questions — never leave a fake number in **Attendance** to fill silence
- `N/A - our event` when the row is coalition MAF planning
- `Historical reference only` for prior-year rows not in current comp set
- `Not autumn competitive set` for out-of-season reference rows (e.g. IKF)

## Future columns (deferred)

Scheduling tier, roll-up arc, R-tier, capstone event, weeks before capstone, recommended slot, collision flag, network member flag, relationship product — add to Sheet + this doc together when substance phase starts.
